Look over the code in app.py related to authentication.

How is the logged in user being kept track of?
-> by using @app.before_request, on every request, it checks if there's a CURR_USER_KEY in session. 
if yes, it sets g.user to currently logged-in user. 
And on other functions where authorization needs, it checkes if g.user is not none.

What is the purpose of add_user_to_g?
-> like mentioned above, it's purpose is to see if CURR_USER_KEY is in the session. 

What does @app.before_request mean?
-> It means run the registered function before each request.
